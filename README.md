### 🧱 Project Architecture & Code Quality

To ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean structure, this project is built on a **layered (multi-tier) architecture**, with a strong focus on modern development standards:

### ✅ Key Practices & Principles

- 🧠 **Rich Domain Model** is adopted: domain entities encapsulate both data and relevant behavior (e.g., validation, business rules), rather than being just anemic data holders.
- 📦 **Record-based DTOs** (`record` keyword in Java 16+) are used for immutable, concise data transport with built-in `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`.
- 🔁 **Builder Pattern** is used in entity creation to promote immutability and readability (e.g., `User`, `Book`).
- 🧼 **Clean Code** principles are followed: meaningful naming, modular structure, low coupling, high cohesion.
- 🔐 **SOLID Principles** are respected:
  - *Single Responsibility* in services and controllers
  - *Open/Closed* via interface-driven design
  - *Liskov Substitution* via proper abstraction
  - *Interface Segregation* and *Dependency Inversion* via injected services and interfaces
- ❗ **Global Exception Handling** via `@ControllerAdvice` with custom exceptions:
  - `ResourceNotFoundException`
  - `ResourceAlreadyExistsException`
- 🛡️ **Validation** is enforced using Jakarta Bean Validation annotations (`@Valid`, `@NotBlank`, `@Email`, etc.) at both controller and DTO levels.
- 🧪 **Best Practices** were implemented by studying official documentation, industry standards, and open-source architectures.

This results in a **robust, maintainable, testable, and production-ready** application structure.

## ER Diagram

Below is the ER Diagram showing the database schema used in the project:

![library_db](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49a83124-4375-491b-b4d8-d8146638207c)

## Entities

> All data is validated using `javax.validation` constraints, ensuring proper format and input integrity.
> DTOs are implemented as immutable Java `record`s, promoting concise, thread-safe, and boilerplate-free code.

### 📘 Author

Stores author details with unique name and description. Each author can be associated with multiple books via a one-to-many relationship.

### 📗 Book

Contains book metadata such as title, ISBN, description, genre, publication date, and number of copies. Each book is linked to one author and one category. Borrowing logic is embedded using rich domain methods (`borrow`, `returnBook`, `updateAvailability`).

### 📒 Category

Defines categories/genres that group books. Each category can be associated with multiple books.

### 📕 BorrowItem

Represents a single item in a user's borrowing transaction. It is related to the `User`, `Book`, and `BorrowRecord` entities.

Each `BorrowItem` stores the `borrow date`, `due date`, `return date`, and whether it has been returned.
When a book is returned, the `markAsReturned()` method is called to finalize the return and update the book's availability. This structure is essential for `tracking active` and `overdue loans`.

### 📙 BorrowRecord

Represents a user's borrowing transaction, which can contain multiple borrowed books (`BorrowItem`). It includes details such as borrow date and due date, and is linked to the user who initiated the borrowing. Acts as a wrapper to group multiple `BorrowItem` instances for reporting, tracking, and due management.

Tracks a user's borrowing session. Contains the borrow date, due date, and a list of `BorrowItem` entries. Establishes a many-to-one relationship with `User`.

### 👤 User

Stores user details such as name, email, password, and phone number. Implements `UserDetails` for Spring Security integration. Each user is associated with a role and can have multiple borrowings and tokens.
Represents the system users, including login credentials and role information. Can borrow multiple books.

### 📘 Role

Represents a user's role in the system with a name and description. Connects users to their permissions.

### 🟪 ERole (Enum)

Enumerates the available roles: `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_LIBRARIAN`. Used in the `Role` entity for Spring Security.

### 🛡️ Token

Represents `access` and `refresh tokens` assigned to users. Each token has a unique value and is typed as `BEARER`. Tokens can be `revoked` or `expired`. This structure enables multi-session management and helps track the user's active authenticated sessions. Each token is linked to a single user.

## Key Features

### 🧪 Default Users

The following default users are automatically created for testing purposes:

| Role       | Email                | Password     |
|------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Librarian  | librarian@gmail.com  | Password123  |
| User       | user@gmail.com       | Password123  |

🔒 **Note:** All default users share the same password: `Password123`. You can change it after logging in if needed.

### 📚 Book Management

* **Add Book**: Librarians can add books with details like title, author, ISBN, publication date, and genre. Input is validated.
* **View Book Details**: All authenticated users can view book details.
* **Search Books**: Users can search books by title, category name, author name, ISBN, or genre. Pagination is supported.
* **Update Book**: Librarians can update book details.
* **Delete Book**: Librarians can remove books from the system.

### 👤 User Management

* **User Registration**: All users can register with the default role: ROLE\_USER.
* **Role Management**: Roles (LIBRARIAN or USER) can be assigned by LIBRARIAN users.
* **View User**: Librarians can view all users. Users can view their own information.
* **Update User**: Librarians can update any user. Users can update their own information.
* **Delete User**: Librarians can remove users from the system.

### 🔄 Borrowing & Returning

* **Borrow a Book**
  Users can borrow multiple books in a single transaction. The system checks:

  * Whether the user has reached the maximum borrow limit
  * Whether the user has overdue items
  * Whether the selected books are available

* **Return a Book**
  Librarians and users can mark books as returned. The system:

  * Sets the return date
  * Automatically updates the book's availability and number of copies

* **Borrow Record Management**
  Librarians can:

  * View all borrow records with pagination
  * Filter borrow records by user, email, or date range
  * Check if a user is eligible to borrow (overdue records and active borrow status)
  * Check book availability based on stock and status

* **Borrow Item Insights**
  The system provides:

  * All borrow items per user
  * Active borrow items and overdue item checks
  * Count of active borrow items per user
  * Overdue borrow item reports
  * Borrow records filtered by book, author, or category
  * Borrow statistics by date range

## User Flow

### 🔐 Registration and Login

* Every newly registered user is assigned the `ROLE_USER` by default.
* A librarian must register first, then another librarian can assign them the `ROLE_LIBRARIAN`.

### 📚 Book Borrowing Flow

* When a user borrows a book:

  * A new `BorrowRecord` is created.
  * Each book is registered as a `BorrowItem` under that record.
  * Borrow date and due date are automatically calculated.

* When a user returns a book:

  * Return date is saved.
  * The book's copy count and availability are updated.
  * The corresponding `BorrowItem` and `BorrowRecord` are marked as returned.
  * The user's borrow eligibility is recalculated.

This structured flow ensures data integrity and accurate tracking of library operations.

## JWT and Security

Authentication and authorization are implemented using Spring Security and JWT. The system has the following features:

* Endpoints for user registration, login, logout, token refresh, and access control
* Passwords are hashed using BCrypt for security
* Stateless authentication using signed JWTs
* Access tokens expire in 1 day
* Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
* Role-based authorization with two roles: USER and LIBRARIAN
* Change password functionality for users and librarians

## Installation and Running

### Requirements

- Java 21
- Maven
- PostgreSQL

### Steps

1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourGithubUserName/LibraryManagementSystem.git
   cd LibraryManagementSystem
   ```

2. Set up PostgreSQL database: (only required if you're not using Docker or prefer manual setup)
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE library_db;
   CREATE USER your_database_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_database_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE library_db TO your_database_user;
   ```

3. Edit the `application.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   server:
     port: 8080

   spring:
     application:
     name: LibraryManagementSystem

   datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/library_db
    username: your_database_user
    password: your_database_password
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
   
   application:
    security:
      jwt:
        secret-key: your-secret-key
        expiration: 86400000 # 1 day
        refresh-token:
          expiration: 604800000 # 7 days
   ```

4. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   java -jar target/library-management-system-1.0.0.jar
   ```

5. The application will run on port 8080: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

## Docker Setup

### Requirements

* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Steps

1. Clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LibraryManagementSystem.git
   cd LibraryManagementSystem
   ```

2. Build the Docker image and start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application:
   [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

This command:

* Starts a PostgreSQL 16 database in the `library-db` container
* Builds the Spring Boot app and runs it in the `library-management-app` container
* Creates the necessary network and volume configurations automatically

To stop the services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove all containers and volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is provided for testing the API endpoints. The collection file can be found at [Postman Collection](https://universal-moon-471224.postman.co/workspace/getir~dfe96672-be35-4e09-8473-6e523bb2df58/collection/22551822-113eeea0-59e7-4b0a-967b-d8c855e3fa19?action=share&creator=22551822&active-environment=22551822-7ca2f1f0-ea3e-45be-a3d8-55bda44c030e) or [postman_collection.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20196648/postman_collection.json)
 in the project's root directory.
 
### Included Features
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Register, login, logout, refresh token
- 📚 **Books**: Create, update, delete, search, and list books
- 👥 **Users**: View, edit, and manage users (by librarians)
- 🔄 **Borrowing**: Borrow, return, and track books
- 🗂 **Categories and Authors**: Full CRUD operations

### Environment Setup
The collection uses a Postman environment with variables such as:
- `{{baseUrl}}`: API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`)
- `{{token}}`: JWT access token (auto-filled after login)

### Authorization Script (Pre-request)
A JavaScript snippet is included to automatically save the access token:
```javascript
pm.environment.set("token", pm.response.json().refresh_token);
```
